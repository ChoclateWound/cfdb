If you wish to contribute, you can do so in a couple ways:

1. If you hate git, and everyone can understand that, simply copy and paste text into an "Issue" and we'll format it correctly and give proper attribution
2. If you are so bold, please submit pull requests

Our format can be found on the template page so you can easily copy and paste it to get you started (you do not have to include an sections that are not applicable, or that you simply don't want to write)
