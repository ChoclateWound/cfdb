# Common Findings Database

The Common Findings Datase is a collection of markdown based findings writeups.
The goal of which is 3 fold:

1. Create a place for collaboration to happen in regard to findings
2. Help to unify finding recommendations and references
3. Assist new and upcoming Information Security professionals in learning

You can find the live, searchable version at http://cfdb.io/

If you wish to contribute, you can do so in a couple ways:

1. If you hate git, and everyone can understand that, simply copy and paste text into an "Issue" and we'll format it correctly and give proper attribution
2. If you are so bold, please submit pull requests

Our format will be as follows so you can easily copy and paste it to get you started (you do not have to include an sections that are not applicable, or that you simply don't want to write):
