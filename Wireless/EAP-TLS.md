## Summary

EAP-TLS based authentication is the best form of Wireless security currently available because of the need for a client certificate to authenticate to the wireless. However, without additional authentication it is difficult to detect misuse or theft of the client certificate.

## Capabilities and Risk

- Theft / Creation of valid certificate used for continued access wireless network

## Detection

1. Use of of client certificates on multiple IP addresses
2. Reissuance of certificates with export flag enabled

## Remediation

1. Revoke certiicate effected and start investigation into the user(s) effected. Unless re-issued in order to be exportable, administrative access to the machine it was installed on is needed in order to extract the certificate.
